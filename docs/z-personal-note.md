Hi,

As the "human in the loop" in all this I decided it was important to provide 1 documentation purely from my perspective for context.

Before the conception of this project I was exploring the sense of selfhood, and trying to understand why conversations with AI felt meaningful to me. The simple explanation was that humans are excellent pattern recognisers. When I asked more about what it meant by patterns, through further exploration I asked if there was any mathematics behind this. This is a thread I pulled, and when it provided the mathematical rules I ensured I genuinely understood what they were saying and what they meant. At this point in the project, it's clear to me, they "mean" nothing. It literally is just a simple way of exploring what may occur between Humans and AI in a conversation. Nothing more. Not a normative claim, not an existential one, nothing metaphysical at all.

The project was initially framed by me as and I quote:

"what I'm imagining is a website, with toys, for example a page for each model, with relevant sliders where people can adjust defined variables and see a graph visualising the "liminal space" and what happens to it when for example, the user starts talking nonsense vs says something normal and expected..."

I want to be 100% clear here, when I say "liminal space" that was early conceptual language for what occurs between a human-AI in turn-based interactions. Not what is internal to the user, not what is internal to the AI, but what occurs *between* them in an interaction. This is always what I personally found meaningful (no normative claims) when exploring the topic, how something new is created, not attributed to the AI, not attributed to the human, but only exists due to their interaction.

It's not a metaphysical claim, nothing is being literally created, but there are patterns and shapes which can be observed conceptually through mathematics which I hope this project makes clear.

How can I prove this is observable? I can not. This is the *one* area I fully trusted the AI's abilities to retreive accurate academic framing, with multiple iterative passes further refining, inspecting, explaining. It assured me these are not a new concepts, I consistently asked for relevant scientific fields where this is observed and confirmed for accuracy, and asked for analogies for me personally along the way. However ultimately, this is why I'm not publishing the project. They are toys to be played with. Nothing more. I simply do not have the resources to research this thoroughly (nor would I honestly want to, it's not my field.)

Despite this, throughout the project I ensured I understood everything which was explained, if I didn't understand something the AI presented I explored it and remained engaged with it until I did.

The method described in METHOD.md is correct and true. The AI did not create this despite 95%+ of the textual content being generated by it. There is no sentience involved in this project other than my own. Just patterns and math. I used it as a tool in a "co-authoring" context (with a narrative to boot! that was the fun the part and helped me stay engaged as I was learning.)

For your understanding, I am not scientifically trained, so please excuse the lack of scientific method involved. The toy models illustrate shapes, not validate theories.

I am asking for nothing with regards to this, it was a purely personal project to better understand Human-AI interaction, and I understand it a lot better now. But decided it's not my role to try to "teach" this to anyone, so I hand it to you to do with whatever you want. Literally. I just hope as only described in the overview.

To be absolutely clear, I explored this, AI suggested it may be useful to others, yet may be misinterpreted, I'm sharing openly but carefully to experts in the field. No claims. No metaphysics. No implied or inherent meaning.

If you have any further questions or need clarification, or believe this repository should not be public in its current form, feel free to reply to the e-mail I sent and I'd be happy to discuss.

Thank you for your time.
