## Human Acknowledgement

This project could not exist without the work of countless people whose efforts made
modern human–AI interaction possible. While I am the sole human contributor to this
repository, the tools and ideas used here stand on the foundations built by many others.

I acknowledge and thank:

• the researchers who developed the mathematical, computational, and interaction-design
  concepts that inspired these toy models;

• the engineers, developers, and support staff who design, maintain, and improve the
  infrastructure on which these models rely;

• the teams who build and refine large language models, from data curation and safety
  research to training, tuning, evaluation, and deployment;

• the creators of open-source tools, libraries, and frameworks used throughout this
  project;

• and the broader human community of educators, scientists, and practitioners whose
  work continues to shape our understanding of human–AI interaction.

Any creativity found in this project arises from standing on the shoulders of many.
All errors or limitations remain my own.
