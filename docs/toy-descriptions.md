# 🏝️ Toy Name
*Short, neutral tagline summarizing the toy.*

A brief explanation of what the toy shows, framed as an abstract pattern:
- Describe the toy’s core dynamic.
- Clarify that the variable(s) represent numerical or spatial states.
- State that the model captures observable interaction-level structure, not internal cognition.
- Summarize the forces or tendencies the toy explores.

# ⚙️ Sliders

### Parameter 1 — role
Explain what it changes mathematically, how it shapes the trajectory, and what
surface-level conversational phenomenon this resembles (if applicable).

### Parameter 2 — role
Same structure.

### Parameter 3 — role
Same structure (if applicable).

# 🐾 One practical raccoon-style intuition
A simple, friendly example mapping the toy’s behavior to an everyday pattern in
turn-based interaction, without implying minds or intentions.

# 🧭 Fields this dynamic draws from
- List of conceptual inspirations (control theory, dynamical systems, etc.)
- Clarify these are inspirations, not literal mechanisms.

# ✔️ What this toy represents
- A numerical/spatial signal evolving over steps
- Structural forces acting on that signal
- Surface-level pattern tendencies in iterative processes

# ✘ What this toy does *not* represent
This toy does not represent:
- thoughts
- feelings
- intentions
- personality
- cognition
- internal human or AI processes
- sentiment or interpretation
- agentic steering or preferences
- model “modes” or psychological states
