## 🛡️ **Ethical Statement**

This project is designed to promote understanding of conversational dynamics without making claims about the internal states of humans or AI systems. The models are strictly illustrative, not diagnostic or predictive. They do not represent cognition, emotion, agency, or consciousness in artificial systems, nor do they infer psychological states in users.

All visualizations are simplified, educational tools intended to help people reason about **conversation**, not **minds**.

## **2. Human Complexity Acknowledgement**

Human communication is complex.

People bring emotions, interpretations, context, expectations, habits, cognitive biases, and shifting mental states into a conversation. These factors can influence how dialogue unfolds, but **this project does not model them**.

Instead, the models focus on **observable interaction patterns**—changes in conversational behavior that emerge from back-and-forth exchanges—not the internal psychology that may shape them.

This project makes **no claims** about:

- emotional states
- personality structure
- cognitive traits
- mental health
- attachment patterns
- introspective ability
- or any internal mental processes

Any resemblance between toy-model behavior and human experience is a result of *interaction dynamics*, not psychological modeling.

## **How to Read These Toys Responsibly**

### **1. These models show patterns, not minds.**

They visualize how signals behave in simple dynamical systems — not how people think, feel, or change internally.

Any resemblance to psychological or emotional processes is coincidental and should not be interpreted literally.

### **2. The variables are abstract, not personal.**

Each slider, curve, or spiral represents a mathematical quantity — not your personality, not your emotional state, not the AI’s feelings.

Treat them like you would color sliders in a graphics editor: expressive, but not meaningful in themselves.

### **3. Play with curiosity, not interpretation.**

Ask:

- “What does this *show*?”
- “What can I *notice*?”
- “How does changing one parameter affect the whole system?”

Avoid asking:

- “What does this say about me?”
- “Is this how GPT behaves internally?”
- “Is this model diagnosing my conversation style?”

It’s not.

### **4. Think of these toys as conceptual microscopes.**

They highlight shapes and tendencies — drift, saturation, feedback — not the actual mechanisms behind human or machine cognition.

### **5. If something feels emotionally resonant, that’s human pattern-making.**

Humans naturally create meaning out of shapes and motion.

That’s normal.

Just remember the toys are abstractions, not metaphors for your mind or for AI internal processes.

### **6. These toys help explain “why it feels a certain way,” not “what is truly happening.”**

Understanding interaction *dynamics* can make conversations feel less mysterious while staying firmly grounded in what’s safe and accurate.
