# Toy Specifications File
# This file defines high-level specifications for each toy before implementation.
# Each toy block should be completed manually, then converted into the formal template prior to coding.

# Toy {Number}: {Toy Name}
status: draft

## 1. Core Idea
(Describe the mathematical interaction dynamic illustrated by this toy.)

## 2. Formula
(List the recurrence, potential function, threshold function, or vector field using only allowed mathematical forms.)

## 3. User-Controlled Parameters
(List each parameter with name, meaning, and range constraints.)

## 4. Visualization
(Describe the intended technical visualization, such as time-series, trajectory plot, potential field, vector field, or grid map.)

## 5. What This Shows
(List only interaction-level mathematical behaviors such as stability, drift, thresholds, noise sensitivity, coupling, oscillation, saturation, attractors, or path dependence.)

## 6. What This Does Not Show
(List the required exclusions: no AI cognition, no internal states, no memory, no emotion, no agency, no neural network behavior, no psychology, no social dynamics.)

## 7. Limitations
(List technical limitations such as scalar state, simplified model, linear approximation, non-predictive behavior, or visualization constraints.)

## 8. Notes (Optional)
(Additional notes for template conversion.)
