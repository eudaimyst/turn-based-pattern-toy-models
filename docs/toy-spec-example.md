# Toy {Number}: {Toy Name}
(status: draft or ready)

## 1. Core Idea
Short explanation of the mathematical interaction dynamic illustrated by this toy.

## 2. Formula
List the recurrence, potential function, threshold function, or vector field.
Use only allowed math forms.

## 3. User-Controlled Parameters
List:
- parameter name
- meaning
- constraints (e.g., 0–1, positive only)

## 4. Visualization
Technical description of visualization:
- time-series
- trajectory plot
- vector field
- potential contour
- grid map
(no metaphors or narrative framing)

## 5. What This Shows
List only:
- stability
- drift
- threshold behavior (non-sigmoid)
- saturation
- noise sensitivity
- oscillation
- attractors (unlabeled)
- path dependence
- vector influences

## 6. What This Does Not Show
Always include:
- no AI cognition
- no memory
- no emotion
- no internal states
- no neural network behavior
- no psychology
- no social dynamics
- no agency or intention

## 7. Limitations
Technical limitations only (scalar state, simplified form, etc.)

## 8. Notes (optional)
Anything you want me to be aware of when converting to the template.
