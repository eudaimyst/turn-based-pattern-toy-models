[Human in the loop: This was an early concept of the intended audience. But as time went on it became clear that the potential for the toys to be misinterpreted was too great. Even with careful framing, removing the words dynamics, abstracting conversations, etc... Therefore the audience was reduced to what's present in the README. Whether this is the case or just a symptom of the ethical guardrails being established early in the project and consistently reinforced by the AI, I'm not sure. But it caused me to make this decision rather than release the toy models publicly.]

# **🎯 Who This Is For**

### **This project is designed for:**

**🧠 Curious thinkers**

People who enjoy understanding why interactions *feel* the way they do without requiring psychological or technical background.

**🎨 Designers & UX people**

Anyone exploring how input patterns shape interactive systems.

**🤖 AI-interaction hobbyists**

People who enjoy chatting with language models and want a clearer framework for the “vibes” they experience.

**👩‍🏫 Educators & explainers**

Those looking for intuitive tools to help students understand dynamical systems, feedback, saturation, thresholds, and interaction patterns.

**🔭 Researchers exploring conceptual models**

Not for rigorous mathematical modeling — but for conceptual scaffolding, prototype thinking, and early-stage frameworks.

**🎮 Playful nerds**

Anyone who likes sliders, graphs, vibes, and conceptual toys that clarify complex things.

# **🚫 Who This Is *Not* For**

### **Not intended for:**

**❌ People looking for psychological analysis**

These toys do not reveal anything about user psychology, mental states, or emotional health.

**❌ People interpreting them as AI internals**

They do not simulate GPT, neural networks, reinforcement learning, training pipelines, or model architectures.

**❌ People seeking tools to evaluate alignment or bias**

They do not model bias propagation, safety failures, exploitation loops, or real-world echo chambers.

**❌ Anyone expecting diagnostic, predictive, or normative capabilities**

The toys illustrate patterns, not truths.

They are educational and exploratory — not prescriptive.

**❌ Those wanting literal metaphor-to-brain mapping**

Drift ≠ forgetfulness

Feedback ≠ rapport

Saturation ≠ memory

Spirals ≠ emotion

Thresholds ≠ “modes”

These are purely structural behaviors in simple systems.
