# Human–AI Interaction Dynamics Explorer

A collection of interactive toy models for visualizing abstract interaction patterns that arise during text-based human–AI exchanges.  
These models use simple mathematical constructs (recurrence relations, damping, noise, thresholds, potential fields) to illustrate stability, drift, saturation, and related dynamics.

The toy models:
- do not represent AI cognition
- do not represent human psychology
- do not simulate neural networks, activations, or internal model states
- do not describe emotion, identity, or intention
- do not model real-world social or political systems

They illustrate only **interaction-level behavior** at the level of input/output relations.

Documentation is located in:

- `docs/overview.md`
- `docs/development-guidelines.md`
- `docs/toy-template.md`

Source code for visualizations is located in `/src` (Svelte + D3).
